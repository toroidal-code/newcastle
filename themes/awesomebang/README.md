# AwesomeBang by [Nicolas McCurdy](http://thenickperson.com)
A minimal, [CrunchBang Linux](http://crunchbanglinux.org/) style theme for the
[awesome window manager](http://awesome.naquadah.org/).

## About
This theme is based off of the default awesome theme and inspired by the color
schemes of Openbox and tint2 in recent versions of CrunchBang Linux, using
similar color values and CrunchBang's default (solid gray) wallpaper. While this
theme looks great on CrunchBang, you can use it on any system that has awesome
installed.

## Installation

1. Download the theme and move (or symlink) it to ~/.config/awesome/themes/.
If you want to put it somewhere else, you will need to update the value of
themedir (in theme.lua) to the proper location.

2. Edit your rc.lua file and change your beautiful theme so there's a line that
looks like this:
`beautiful.init("/home/USERNAME/.config/awesome/themes/awesomebang/theme.lua")`

3. Restart awesome (super-ctrl-r) and enjoy!
