# Kate's config files for Linux/Unix software
Shamelessly forked from [Nick's castle](https://github.com/thenickperson/castle)

## About
This is my castle (dotfile repo) for
[homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick), which makes it easier for me
to store and move around my config files with a git repo. Please note that my
install script installs homeshick for you, so you won't need to worry about
that.

## Installation
`wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/toroidal-code/newcastle/master/bootstrap.sh | bash`
